# Description

This Project aim to create a Kubernetes Operator that can aggregate many `TLS Secret` into one single `Opaque Secret` with many files.
It uses the "new" [Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) and is build using the [Operator SDK Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk)

## Overview
![certmerge-operator high level overview diagram](/docs/images/CertMerge-Operator.png)

1. The user push Manifests to create some Certificates
1. Cert-Manager is triggered and create to corresponding TLS Secrets
1. CertMerge Operator watch for Secrets and is triggered when Cert-Manager create or update them
1. CertMerge Operator also watch for CertMerge requests. In our case, we decided to merge ALL certificates with a Label certmerge=true into ONE SINGLE Opaque Secret.
   This is due to Istio limitation to only mount one secret inside the Ingress Gateway.
1. CertMerge Operator create the Istioâ€™s needed Secret
1. the Istio Ingress Gateway watch for Gateway Resources. Each Gateway is defined to use a different certificate name (coming from the same single Secret which is mounted at start)

## Use case

### Cert-Manager + Istio

Cert manager create a TLS Secret for each certificate you request
Istio Ingress Gateway can only mount ONE secret for the SSL certificates

Using the Cert-Operator, we can use Cert-Manager to create many TLS Secrets and merge them into a single multi-file Secret that can be used by Istio Gateways.

# Usage
You need to install many Manifests to setup the Operator.
For the moment it creates a `cert-merge` Namespace and setup the operator inside.
You can then put the `CertMerge` Manifests anywhere in the cluster.

## Building from source
You need Operator SDK CLI to be able to build.
Follow the [QuickStart](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk#quick-start) to build it.

Then : 
```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/prune998
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prune998
git clone https://github.com/prune998/certmerge-operator.git
cd certmerge-operator

operator-sdk generate k8s
operator-sdk build prune/cert-operator
docker push  prune/cert-operator
```
As you obviously can't write to the Docker Hub Registry ``prune/cert-operator``, don't `docker push` it  :)

## Using Docker Image
A docker image is available using Docker Hub Registry. Simply pull from there :
```
docker pull prune/cert-operator
```

## Deploying the Operator
You need a working Kubernetes Cluster and a configured `kubectl`.
Use `kubectl cluster-info` to ensure everything is fine prior to deploying the Operator.

The Operator is configured to deploy in `cert-operator` Namespace and use a ClusterRole to give read access to `Secret` resources.
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/namespace.yaml
kubectl -n cert-merge apply -f deploy/service_account.yaml
kubectl -n cert-merge apply -f deploy/role.yaml
kubectl -n cert-merge apply -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
kubectl -n cert-merge apply -f deploy/certmerge_v1alpha1_certmerge_crd.yaml
kubectl -n cert-merge apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

## Test
You can install some secrets that will trigger the test Custom Resources. Secrets are installed in the Default Namespace for testing purpose :
```
kubectl -n default apply -f deploy/test_secrets
kubectl -n default apply -f deploy/test_cr
```

# TODO


- [ ] namespaced secrets  
      For the moment the operator is able to merge any secret from any namespace. As data inside the CertMerge's Secrets is not namespaced, you could end with one secret overwriting another one with the same name from another namespace.
The solution is to name each secret's data by `<namespace>-<secret-name>.(key|crt)`. 
I still need to check the implication when using the certificate with Istio.
- [ ] improve security  
      The Operator can read any `Secret` in a `Namespace` and merge it in another `Namespace`. This is highly insecure and gives too much power over a sensible resource.
- [ ] inform Istio (Envoy) when a file (a `Certificate`) inside a merged `Secret` is updated

# API
## CertMerge Custom Resource Definition 

```

apiVersion: certmerge.lecentre.net/v1alpha1
kind: CertMerge
metadata:
  name: "test-certmerge-labels"
spec:
  selector:
    - labelselector:
        matchLabels:
          env: "dev"
          certmerge: "true"
      namespace: default
  secretlist:
  - name: test-ingressgateway-certs
    namespace: default
  - name: test-tls-secret
    namespace: default
  name: test-cert-merge
  namespace: default
```
### Selector
The selector is a list of LabelSelectors (matchLabels only). All labels are evaluated as a boolean AND. 
ex :
1. get all `dev` secrets that are managed by `certmerge` in namespace `default`: 
    ```
      selector:
        - labelselector:
            matchLabels:
              env: "dev"
              certmerge: "true"
          namespace: default
    ```

1. get all `dev` secrets that are managed by `certmerge` in namespace `default` and `prod`: 
    ```
      selector:
        - labelselector:
            matchLabels:
              env: "dev"
              certmerge: "true"
          namespace: default
        - labelselector:
            matchLabels:
              env: "dev"
              certmerge: "true"
          namespace: prod
    ```

1. get all `dev` and `prod` secrets that are managed by `certmerge` in namespace `default`: 
    ```
      selector:
        - labelselector:
            matchLabels:
              env: "dev"
              certmerge: "true"
          namespace: default
        - labelselector:
            matchLabels:
              env: "prod"
              certmerge: "true"
          namespace: default
    ```

### Secret List
You can specify specific secrets to merge by listing them :
```
  secretlist:
  - name: test-secret-1
    namespace: default
  - name: test-secret-2
    namespace: prod
```
